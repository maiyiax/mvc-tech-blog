# mvc-tech-blog

## Purpose

Build a CMS-style blog site similar to a Wordpress site, where developers can publish their blog posts and comment on other developer' posts as well. The app should follow the MVD paradigm in its architectural structure, using Handlebars.js as the templating language, Sequilize as the ORM and the express-session npm package for authentication.
